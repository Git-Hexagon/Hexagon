Controls the quality and quantity of units to be deployed into battle. The implementation of this alert state and its protocol has thus caused the Regime to drastically change its usual order of battle, deciding not to send tangents directly into the fray, but instead only a few ships for data gathering. After that, the appropriate tangents and units would be deployed. Related Notes: The Regime, learning from the wars that their predecessor organization has participated in, has begun to utilize a mobilization system that\u2019s dependent on the state of combat within the region. Aptly named the Escalation Protocol , this state of alert is automatically calculated by onboard mainframe modules from within command and control vessels. These modules take in real-time data from units currently participating in combat, and mobilizes the necessary agents and vessels accordingly. Should 60% of the currently deployed forces be destroyed, the Escalation Protocol would be activated and the state of escalation is immediately advanced by one level, up to \\(Dynamic\\, State\\, C_{10}\\) . Should the data gathering vessels be destroyed before the main forces arrive, the state of escalation is raised immediately to \\(Dynamic\\, State\\, Z^1_6\\) .

Vessels in italics are Post-Shatter Vessels, and are unique to the Apeirogon Regime. Related Notes: There are several space vessels that the Hexagon and the Regime have utilised over the course of their active service. Due to how widespread the Hexagon/Regime are in the Multiverse and beyond, major territorial hot-spots have vastly different vessels and ships when compared to the other. However, at the most basic level, these are the most major variants of such vessels. Superstructure Variants \u00b6 Citadel \u00b6 The Citadel is a large, usually non-combat artificially built star-ship outpost designed to dock, supply, and warp in Hexagon/Regime units and vessels. Easily the largest superstructure within the Hexagon/Regime fleets, it was the core outpost for every Hexagon galactic territory beyond their home universe. However, in the Apeirogon Regime, it\u2019s rarely deployed more than once in a galaxy group, however Collapse Citadels will always be found in every universe. There are combat-class Citadels, however, these Citadels are extremely rare, and are only deployed simply due to an escalation of arms. Types of Citadels \u00b6 Anchor Citadel Support Vessel/Mobile Outpost Used to serve as a refuelling and resupply station for Hexagon and allied vessels. Usually immobile. Has no offensive capabilities. Relay Citadel Support Vessel/Mobile Outpost Used to serve as a warp station for Hexagon vessels. Usually immobile. Has decent offensive capabilities. Hive Citadel Support Vessel Used to serve as a refuelling and resupply station for Hexagon and allied vessels within combat areas. Has minimal offensive capabilities. Void Citadel Combat Vessel Used to break through heavily defended areas using superior firepower. Acquisition Citadel Expansion Vessel Used to create Nexus Superstructures for resource acquisition. Has no offensive capabilities. Grand Citadel Support Vessel/Mobile Outpost A combination of the past Anchor and Relay Citadels. Deploys a galaxy-wide area of interference around it, which disrupts enemy communications/relays. Area of interference is further propagated by Stellar Spires , allowing for a much wider area of protection against hostile FTL and communications. Has decent offensive capabilities. Collapse Citadel Support Vessel A specialised Citadel carrying a Multiversal-Range Void Interference Module. Heavily armed and protected, this is a critical part of the Regime\u2019s transportation beyond their Multiverse. Crypt Citadel Support Vessel A unique Citadel used to contain extremely dangerous artefacts and entities for transport. It\u2019s run by a skeleton crew of humans or machines, depending on the artefact or entity that\u2019s being transported. Once compromised, the Citadel releases a massive Void charge, erasing it and everything within a parsec around it. Has extremely overpowering offensive capabilities. Spire \u00b6 Spires , also known as the Deathbringers before the Shatter, large military vessels designed to act as a way point or a defensive structure for use as a larger set in a defence in depth. Types of Spires \u00b6 Deathbringer Combat Vessel Mobile Combat Outpost, features an extensive defence and weapons platform to which it can use to great effect. Is capable of breaking through planets. Stellar Spire Support Vessel Immobile Reconnaissance Outpost, features minimal offensive capabilities but has an advanced jamming and disruption relay. Improves the capabilities of the Grand Citadel. Deployed in random areas around Grand Citadels (at least one per 50 parsecs), it acts as a galaxy group outpost\u2019s threat mitigation system. Like other spires, these spires are capable of docking or warping smaller ships and vessels for resupply and reinforcement. Horizon Spire Support Vessel Propagated ubiquitously near or within borders, and sparingly within allied or Regime Territory. Features an advanced scanner and detection system that\u2019s capable of picking up anomalous or unusual activity within an area diameter of about five parsecs. Features an excellent defence and weapons platform to which it can utilise should it come under attack. Like other spires, these spires are capable of docking or warping smaller ships and vessels for resupply and reinforcement. Extensively deployed within realms beyond the Hexagon\u2019s domain in order for vessels and units to fully utilise their offensive capabilities. Crystal Spire Combat Vessel Deployed in large numbers within heavy combat zones, these spires are equipped with powerful, anti-ship weaponry that\u2019s capable of taking down multiple small moons when utilised in full power. Like other spires, these spires are capable of docking or warping smaller ships and vessels for resupply and reinforcement. Rift Spire Combat Vessel Deployed sparingly within heavy combat zones. Utilises spatial manipulation to move and interact. Tears through hostile ships and defences and bolsters the defences of allied ships. Like other spires, these spires are capable of docking or warping smaller ships and vessels for resupply and reinforcement. Carries Parsec-Range Void Interference Modules, allowing ships to escape Voidspace near the spires. Interlink Spire Support Vessel Deployed ubiquitously within areas outside of the Regime\u2019s home Layer. Interlink Spires directly tear through the fabrics of reality to force a connection with the Pierenne Interlink in order to receive reinforcements and supplies. The amount of Interlink Spires present within an outpost cluster is indicative on how important such an outpost cluster is. Gate \u00b6 Gates are large mega-structures that are utilised by the Hexagon and the Regime as a method of acquiring exotic materials or performing large and complicated tasks. These are one of the most, if not the most common types of mega-structures in the Hexagon and the Regime. Types of Gates \u00b6 Void Gate A large, circular gate that\u2019s used to mine Void Particles outside of the Hexagon\u2019s home Multiverse. Extremely volatile, and has no offensive capabilities. Must be defended at all costs. Rapid Vessel Construction Gate The successor to previous space vessel fabricators, the RVC Gate is a specialised manufacturing gate that\u2019s designed to construct multiple Regime Vessels in an extremely quick and optimised manner. Usually connected to so-called \u2018Breeder Planets\u2019, these gates are capable of amassing small fleets consisting of hundreds of ships in a month, complete with a crew. Instantaneous Bidirectional Spatial Transportation Gate A large, circular gate designed to connect two locations to one another, allowing for instantaneous travel. It\u2019s large enough to fit three stacked Pre-Shatter Alpha Catalyses, and several other gates are located within the structure itself, allowing for the transportation of cargo, equipment, and personnel. Resource Gate A small gate that\u2019s usually part of a larger structure known as a Resource Acquisition Depot. Built in groups of six, these small gates are connected to a small containment facility that houses several artificial spatial fields that are designed to hold an enormously large amount of raw materials. These depots are then connected to the Local Interlink or to the larger Pierenne Interlink for RVC Gates and other macro and micro-scale fabricators to continuously fabricate ad infinitum. High-Security Stasis Gate A medium-sized gate that\u2019s developed by the Regime to contain highly anomalous entities and materials. Ceryn \u00b6 Ceryn are large capital vessels designed by the Regime to achieve spatial dominance over hostile ships. Heavily armed and protected, and utilising some of the most powerful modules and technologies within the Regime, Ceryn are usually found leading a massive tangent, spearheading the assault through sheer superior firepower. Ceryn are further divided into three classifications, each having their own sub-types. There are usually two of these ships in one Tangent, with at the very least one Serrht leading the charge. Types of Ceryn \u00b6 Serrht Heavily protected vessels that pull enemy projectiles towards it through several MARS, however said MARS may be used to perform abilities of the other Ceryn in a smaller efficiency. Enemy projectiles are usually dissipated and processed into their most basic components, or launched back towards enemy attackers. Carries a secondary detachable vessel within it. Acts as the primary command-and-control vessel of the fleet. Command centre is located within said detachable vessel, allowing the officers to escape should the primary vessel be destroyed or taken. Gradht Lean and slim vessels capable of masking most detectable signals of Hexagon vessels through specialised MARS. Other specialised Gradht are capable of creating decoy signals, illusion ships, and many more. Rukht Large and bulky vessels capable of connecting to the Interlink. Generally follows behind the fleet, and protected by a large assortment of unmanned drones and fighters, Rukhts act as mobile ship producers of the fleet, allowing them to take material and personnel from the Interlink and fabricate necessary ships when needed. Sanckht \u00b6 Sanckht are easily mass-produced combat vessels designed by the Regime for a large assortment of combat purposes. While more of a general classification than an actual ship type, Sanckht are divided into several types, which excel in their appropriate duties and purposes. Types of Sanckht \u00b6 Akadht Generalised Assault Vessel Small and fast vessels that are usually accompanied by large swarms of smaller and quicker unmanned attack craft. These unmanned craft usually act as sword and shield to these vessels, pestering larger ships while the Akadht attacks with its stronger weaponry, or taking the brunt of incoming attacks that could easily defeat it. Some variants of the Akadht are capable of creating more drones, at the cost of having one or more of its modules replaced with fabricators, leading to diminished performance in the modules it replaced. A select few Akadht types have real space drives installed. Giywn Interceptor Unit Extremely small vessels that have several built-in warp drives and time-manipulation modules whose main purpose is to track down and follow or destroy warping spacecraft. Some variants are best suited for tracking and marking locations, while others are best suited for combat and actual interception.

Due to the danger of being in extremely close proximity to Void Particles , belligerents have thus developed several tactics and doctrines that are vastly different from ordinary space combat . Related Notes: The Void is an extremely hostile area that\u2019s dangerous to all known entities and materials. Topographically located far beyond all the metaphysical layers of reality and unreality, the Void exists as the final boundary between areas of space, matter, and material\u2014both physical and metaphysical. Time itself does not work within the Void, and thus, sufficiently advanced civilizations have used the Void as a method of Faster-Than-Light travel. Differentiating itself from the other Voids known to other civilizations is its inherent quality of passively generating an informationally destructive force known also as the Void Particle. Voidspace does not have any inhabitants or structures of its own, it is only a bottomless sea of information-destroying particles. Due to this, Void Combat is an extremely risky and dangerous area of combat that\u2019s performed by only a few of the civilizations that are technologically advanced enough to enter it. Due to the danger of Void Particles, ships and vessels do not last very long in the Void, and as such, Void combat is usually a battle of endurance , where ships initiate combat with other ships from within the Void with the intent of opening a hole or creating a structural weakness on the enemy ship\u2019s shielding, allowing Void particles to seep through, and completely erasing any trace of the ship from reality. Battles that take too long would usually be won by ships with superior shielding, as ships with weaker shielding would have to jump out of Voidspace or have their drives fail, letting themselves be consumed by the Void. Void shielding is treated as a limited resource, and a ship would have to return to real-space in order to restore its shielding. Staying any longer than the shield is capable of would result in the ship\u2019s protective field being breached, and the ship itself\u2014along with its crew and weapons \u2014would be disintegrated in an instant. Jumping out of Voidspace is not instantaneous (at least to those already within the Void), however. During a cross-dimensional tear, ships would have to wrap themselves with a strong enough field that could bear the stress of tearing and crossing the interdimensional wall. Weapons would cause the field to break, shattering the field and breaking the only form of protection the ship would have. Any opportunistic ships could simply take shots at a fleeing ship, which would destroy the shielding instantly. Failure to practice such precautions has led to the complete destruction of even the most massive ships. Cut-off sections of ships could be seen floating around in real-space, sliced in half during an interrupted dimensional tear. Some ships have found themselves stranded in the Void after a lengthy firefight, having run out of power to sustainably tear the interdimensional wall. No ship\u2014 Hexagon , Regime , or otherwise\u2014has managed to last indefinitely within the Void. The ships that have lasted the longest in the Void have only managed to stay in it for two days, and Void-class superstructures can only last for a month at most. Countermeasures \u00b6 The Hexagon, and as a result the Regime, has developed several countermeasures that would prevent enemy ships from entering Voidspace to mask their approach towards Hexagon territory. The most common type of detection system would be a reactive countermeasure system : a large detector module (usually the size of a small planet) that sweeps a large area, looking for Void breaches. Once detected, several Void-reactionary Ships would immediately enter chronolock and breach Voidspace, with the intent of assaulting enemy Void ships. As combat in the Void does not make use of ordinary munitions, Void-reactionary Ships would have thin hulls and small sizes, lessening weight and area, allowing on-board Void Piercers to operate with extremely high efficiency. They would also have less powerful armaments, but they would be easily supplemented by their large numbers. Void-reactionary Ships are also sometimes installed in larger vessels, such as Akadht Generalised Assault Vessels . These ships usually have less Voidbound weaponry on board and are more likely to be equipped with real-space weaponry or bombs. These types of ships are almost always used as quick-reaction multi-purpose attack craft.","title":"Void Warfare"},{"location":"entries/Void%20Warfare/#countermeasures","text":"The Hexagon, and as a result the Regime, has developed several countermeasures that would prevent enemy ships from entering Voidspace to mask their approach towards Hexagon territory.

These types of ships are almost always used as quick-reaction multi-purpose attack craft.","title":"Countermeasures"},{"location":"hidden/5c.16ns72.p41.0avd/","tags":["meta"],"text":"This message was intercepted by a Solar Expeditionary drone. \u00b6 Half of the message is encrypted by using a Class-3 algorithm, and was successfully decoded.

Our military forces are currently engaging an unknown enemy . Enemy ships are weak yet vastly outnumber ours. Enemies possibly have access to cloning technology inside their ships. Enemy infantry forces easily overwhelm any mounted defence. Enemy infantry forces wield extremely powerful lasers. Our frontier worlds are currently under their control. Orbital bombardment have shown very little to no effect. Belligerents are normally physically weak and mentally slow. Belligerents currently use a combat stimulant . Combat stimulant greatly increases performance on users. Acquisition of said stimulant is extremely difficult. Stimulant is about a thousand times better than our best one. Has currently no known side effects or complications. Currently requesting for additional support and reinforcements. Nearby colonies are unable to take back occupied worlds. Current Course of Action: Monitor Cessalian/Xenim conflict. Dispatch Dreamer units to acquire stimulant.","title":"5c.16ns72.p41.0avd"},{"location":"hidden/5c.16ns72.p41.0avd/#this-message-was-intercepted-by-a-solar-expeditionary-drone","text":"Half of the message is encrypted by using a Class-3 algorithm, and was successfully decoded.
