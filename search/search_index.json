Related Notes: The Hexagon \u2018s Mechanized Rapid Response Unit is a heavily outfitted unit whose goal is to be the first line of defense or the first vanguard of an attack. As such, they\u2019re designed to be quick and mobile, and are expected to adapt to any environment or outcome. Outfitted by very generalized heavy gear, with their most advanced shock troopers even wielding Schwartzhilds Armour , they\u2019re expected to gather initial intelligence for the main force to determine the best course and method of attack. During an assault, slipspace aircraft will bombard the area with neuro-suppressant chemical agents , allowing the unit to operate with minimized resistance from unprotected enemy units. From thereon out, the following slipspace aircraft will begin to drop warp capsules that will serve as the rapid response unit\u2019s gateway to the battlefield, where a multitude of heavy-duty agent complexes, prism walkers , and auxiliary robotic military units will populate the battlefield in less than a minute, preventing the enemy from establishing a proper counter force in time. If the planet has FTL inhibitors , then the Rapid Response Unit will utilize a lone assault ship to attempt a quick land invasion to shut down said inhibitors. If calculated to be ineffective, the unit will attempt a brute-force spatial tear to infiltrate the planet. If proven unsuccessful, then the unit will utilize a Void-class dreadnought .","title":"Hexagon Mechanized Rapid Response Unit"},{"location":"hidden/5c.16ns72.p41.0avd/","tags":["meta"],"text":"This message was intercepted by a Solar Expeditionary drone. \u00b6 Half of the message is encrypted by using a Class-3 algorithm, and was successfully decoded.

Controls the quality and quantity of units to be deployed into battle. The implementation of this alert state and its protocol has thus caused the Regime to drastically change its usual order of battle, deciding not to send tangents directly into the fray, but instead only a few ships for data gathering. After that, the appropriate tangents and units would be deployed. Related Notes: The Regime, learning from the wars that their predecessor organization has participated in, has begun to utilize a mobilization system that\u2019s dependent on the state of combat within the region. Aptly named the Escalation Protocol , this state of alert is automatically calculated by onboard mainframe modules from within command and control vessels. These modules take in real-time data from units currently participating in combat, and mobilizes the necessary agents and vessels accordingly. Should 60% of the currently deployed forces be destroyed, the Escalation Protocol would be activated and the state of escalation is immediately advanced by one level, up to \\(Dynamic\\, State\\, C_{10}\\) . Should the data gathering vessels be destroyed before the main forces arrive, the state of escalation is raised immediately to \\(Dynamic\\, State\\, Z_6^1\\) .
