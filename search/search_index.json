Due to the danger of being in extremely close proximity to Void Particles , belligerents have thus developed several tactics and doctrines that are vastly different from ordinary space combat . Related Notes: The Void is an extremely hostile area that\u2019s dangerous to all known entities and materials. Topographically located far beyond all the metaphysical layers of reality and unreality, the Void exists as the final boundary between areas of space, matter, and material\u2014both physical and metaphysical. Time itself does not work within the Void, and thus, sufficiently advanced civilizations have used the Void as a method of Faster-Than-Light travel. Differentiating itself from the other Voids known to other civilizations is its inherent quality of passively generating an informationally destructive force known also as the Void Particle. Voidspace does not have any inhabitants or structures of its own, it is only a bottomless sea of information-destroying particles. Due to this, Void Combat is an extremely risky and dangerous area of combat that\u2019s performed by only a few of the civilizations that are technologically advanced enough to enter it. Due to the danger of Void Particles, ships and vessels do not last very long in the Void, and as such, Void combat is usually a battle of endurance , where ships initiate combat with other ships from within the Void with the intent of opening a hole or creating a structural weakness on the enemy ship\u2019s shielding, allowing Void particles to seep through, and completely erasing any trace of the ship from reality. Battles that take too long would usually be won by ships with superior shielding, as ships with weaker shielding would have to jump out of Voidspace or have their drives fail, letting themselves be consumed by the Void. Void shielding is treated as a limited resource, and a ship would have to return to real-space in order to restore its shielding. Staying any longer than the shield is capable of would result in the ship\u2019s protective field being breached, and the ship itself\u2014along with its crew and weapons \u2014would be disintegrated in an instant. Jumping out of Voidspace is not instantaneous (at least to those already within the Void), however. During a cross-dimensional tear, ships would have to wrap themselves with a strong enough field that could bear the stress of tearing and crossing the interdimensional wall. Weapons would cause the field to break, shattering the field and breaking the only form of protection the ship would have. Any opportunistic ships could simply take shots at a fleeing ship, which would destroy the shielding instantly. Failure to practice such precautions has led to the complete destruction of even the most massive ships. Cut-off sections of ships could be seen floating around in real-space, sliced in half during an interrupted dimensional tear. Some ships have found themselves stranded in the Void after a lengthy firefight, having run out of power to sustainably tear the interdimensional wall. No ship\u2014 Hexagon , Regime , or otherwise\u2014has managed to last indefinitely within the Void. The ships that have lasted the longest in the Void have only managed to stay in it for two days, and Void-class superstructures can only last for a month at most. Countermeasures \u00b6 The Hexagon, and as a result the Regime, has developed several countermeasures that would prevent enemy ships from entering Voidspace to mask their approach towards Hexagon territory. The most common type of detection system would be a reactive countermeasure system : a large detector module (usually the size of a small planet) that sweeps a large area, looking for Void breaches. Once detected, several Void-reactionary Ships would immediately enter chronolock and breach Voidspace, with the intent of assaulting enemy Void ships. As combat in the Void does not make use of ordinary munitions, Void-reactionary Ships would have thin hulls and small sizes, lessening weight and area, allowing on-board Void Piercers to operate with extremely high efficiency. They would also have less powerful armaments, but they would be easily supplemented by their large numbers. Void-reactionary Ships are also sometimes installed in larger vessels, such as Akadht Generalised Assault Vessels . These ships usually have less Voidbound weaponry on board and are more likely to be equipped with real-space weaponry or bombs. These types of ships are almost always used as quick-reaction multi-purpose attack craft.","title":"Void Warfare"},{"location":"entries/Void%20Warfare/#countermeasures","text":"The Hexagon, and as a result the Regime, has developed several countermeasures that would prevent enemy ships from entering Voidspace to mask their approach towards Hexagon territory.

Controls the quality and quantity of units to be deployed into battle. The implementation of this alert state and its protocol has thus caused the Regime to drastically change its usual order of battle, deciding not to send tangents directly into the fray, but instead only a few ships for data gathering. After that, the appropriate tangents and units would be deployed. Related Notes: The Regime, learning from the wars that their predecessor organisation has participated in, has begun to utilise a mobilisation system that\u2019s dependent on the state of combat within the region. Aptly named the Escalation Protocol , this state of alert is automatically calculated by onboard mainframe modules from within command and control vessels. These modules take in real-time data from units currently participating in combat, and mobilises the necessary agents and vessels accordingly. Should 60% of the currently deployed forces be destroyed, the Escalation Protocol would be activated and the state of escalation is immediately advanced by one level, up to \\(Dynamic\\, State\\, C_{10}\\) . Should the data gathering vessels be destroyed before the main forces arrive, the state of escalation is raised immediately to \\(Dynamic\\, State\\, Z_6\\) .
