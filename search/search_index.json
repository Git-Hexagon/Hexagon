Enemy infantry forces easily overwhelm any mounted defence. Enemy infantry forces wield extremely powerful lasers. Our frontier worlds are currently under their control. Orbital bombardment have shown very little to no effect. Belligerents are normally physically weak and mentally slow. Belligerents currently use a combat stimulant . Combat stimulant greatly increases performance on users. Acquisition of said stimulant is extremely difficult. Stimulant is about a thousand times better than our best one. Has currently no known side effects or complications. Currently requesting for additional support and reinforcements. Nearby colonies are unable to take back occupied worlds. Current Course of Action: Monitor Cessalian/Xenim conflict. Dispatch Dreamer units to acquire stimulant.","title":"5c.16ns72.p41.0avd"},{"location":"hidden/5c.16ns72.p41.0avd/#this-message-was-intercepted-by-a-solar-expeditionary-drone","text":"Half of the message is encrypted by using a Class-3 algorithm, and was successfully decoded.

Related Notes: The Hexagon \u2018s Mechanized Rapid Response Unit is a heavily outfitted unit whose goal is to be the first line of defense or the first vanguard of an attack. As such, they\u2019re designed to be quick and mobile, and are expected to adapt to any environment or outcome. Outfitted by very generalized heavy gear, with their most advanced shock troopers even wielding Schwartzhilds Armour , they\u2019re expected to gather initial intelligence for the main force to determine the best course and method of attack. During an assault, slipspace aircraft will bombard the area with neuro-suppressant chemical agents , allowing the unit to operate with minimized resistance from unprotected enemy units. From thereon out, the following slipspace aircraft will begin to drop warp capsules that will serve as the rapid response unit\u2019s gateway to the battlefield, where a multitude of heavy-duty agent complexes, prism walkers , and auxiliary robotic military units will populate the battlefield in less than a minute, preventing the enemy from establishing a proper counter force in time. If the planet has FTL inhibitors , then the Rapid Response Unit will utilize a lone assault ship to attempt a quick land invasion to shut down said inhibitors. If calculated to be ineffective, the unit will attempt a brute-force spatial tear to infiltrate the planet. If proven unsuccessful, then the unit will utilize a Void-class dreadnought .","title":"Hexagon Mechanized Rapid Response Unit"},{"location":"hidden/Root/","text":"2MhQNgo+B9tL+ORmpQBjAg==;bLPOxC2ZmESFpQZLlUYODVpYfSzOwXbvwEUW++baeEk=;^","title":"Root"},{"location":"hidden/Schwartzhilds%20Armour/","tags":["hexagon","equipment"],"text":"DoOiX7ZL/BiYSclRwVcxqQ==;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;^","title":"Schwartzhilds Armour"},{"location":"home/---/","tags":["meta"],"text":"Welcome to the Encyclopaedia. \u00b6 Current Happenings \u00b6 None Plans \u00b6 None Combat Situations \u00b6 None News \u00b6 The Encyclopaedia is currently indexing all entries.
