Created to operate within enemy territory for an extended period of time, its usual orders are to either wreak havoc behind enemy lines, or to act as the Hexagon\u2019s hidden eyes and hands from beyond their territories. Related Notes: The ExSAT Operatives , or the External Self-sustaining Assault and Tactics Operatives, is an extremely versatile military unit created in an attempt to disrupt enemy operations deep within non-Hexagon territorial borders, allowing the Hexagon to either have a backdoor within other territories, or to deploy their main military units in a combat situation where enemy units are left exposed with little to no reinforcement or resupply. ExSAT Operatives are armed with both light and heavy weaponry, and are fitted with an experimental armour that improves upon the dated Phoenix Operative armour . Equipped with redundant vitals, excessive module attachments, advanced cybernetics, and magi-tech modules; and several instances of additional light protective armour, equipment, and shielding, coupled with multiple installations of Schwartzhilds Armour and even bearing rare Advanced Thaumaturgical Nullification Modules ; ExSAT Operatives are designed to survive through extremely dangerous situations that may prove to be deadly or damaging to even the most well protected Hexagon units, making them one of the most well-protected agents in the entire Regime at the time of their formation. Built-in repair and medical modules are present within the armour to conduct automatic repairs on the armour and the agent, should something pierce through their shielding and armour. ExSAT Operatives are supplied with a fabricator that will allow them to create most basic and some advanced equipment to assist them during their operations. It is their life blood, as it is their only way to break down materials to use for repairs or necessities. The only agent to be supplied with multi-stage Void nanogenerators, ExSAT Operatives are capable of operating even theoretically past their supposed life span even without any connection to the Pierenne Interlink . Should an operative fall in combat, it may be revived by any surviving ExSAT within the field. However, should they be left behind for whatever reason, or if they are restrained without any possible method of escape, they may activate their last resort: a massive Void rift that would encompass a radius of about one-hundred meters or so (fallen operatives will automatically trigger this failsafe once all ExSAT Operatives escape or if they choose to manually trigger the failsafe, allowing it to explode even with any surviving operatives nearby). Due to the operative being one of the most protected agent deployed by the Hexagon and even the Regime, if even one ExSAT Operative dies within the area of operations, the territory will immediately be designated to the highest danger level, even if said fallen is revived. It is then up to the High Command operating within that universe to determine what action should be taken.","title":"ExSAT Operatives"},{"location":"notes/hidden/Schwartzhilds%20Armour/","tags":["hexagon","equipment"],"text":"Clearance : T8.000+ Type : Projected Personal Armour Tech Level : FFT+ A type of projected armour that utilizes multiple redundant Escher\u2019s Devices for protection. Related Notes: Schwartzhild\u2019s Armour is a type of projected armour that\u2019s worn by attaching its module at the back of an agent\u2019s neck. When activated, it enables several modules that provide the wielder with superior protection against physical and magical attacks, while delaying any form of damage caused by other methods of attacks until the agent is relieved of his armour. The armour utilizes several redundant Escher\u2019s devices for protection, giving the agent an extremely powerful defensive advantage over the enemy. However, due to the devices\u2019 fields passing through each other from within a focal point that\u2019s directly above the module, it is imperative to the agent that they must not allow the Schwartzhild\u2019s Armour module to be attacked with a powerful piercing projectile or weapon. The armour is mainly seen being wielded by heavy shock-troopers, specialized rapid support or advanced hard-hitting first response teams.","title":"Schwartzhilds Armour"}]}
