It is a coil-operated chronoresistant ballistic weapon designed with longevity and reliability in mind. Its design allows agents to operate in an extremely prolonged timeframe, with the intent of outlasting the enemy\u2019s physical and logistical limitations in a war of attrition. The Expeditionary Personal Defense Weapon is a compact, moderately-strong coil-gun designed by the Hexagon and the Regime for use as a standard infantry weapon by agents in normal sorties and deployments. Agents in the field have the ability to change the power output of their weapon, allowing them to take on any enemy in any environment, from mitigating collateral damage within a high-population area with a low charge shot, to penetrating through dense, sloped heavy armour with a max charge shot. Capable of firing 6.4x27 HKP-01 Kinetic Penetrator slugs at a fire-rate of about 250 rounds per minute, it\u2019s used to pick off targets\u2014armoured or not\u2014in ranges less than three kilometres or so.

Capable of firing 6.4mm HKP-01 Kinetic Penetrator slugs at a fire-rate of about 650 rounds per minute, it\u2019s mainly used against groups of unarmoured targets or to disable moderately armoured vehicles at ranges less than two kilometres or so. Like the C1.13-00, the C1.13-01A has a casing that allows it to operate within chronostatic environments.

Basically having the same features as its parent weapon, the only difference is that this features a rotating multi-barrelled configuration and a faster rate of fire. It is capable of firing 6.4mm HKP-01 Kinetic Penetrator slugs at a fire-rate of about 2500 rounds per minute.

Operating with a specialised binary firing system, it is designed to fire 8.6mm Specialized Shieldbreaker Spine munitions and 17.2mm Kinetic Penetrator Void-charged Sabots in quick succession at extremely high velocities. It is thus capable of punching through one or two lightly-shielded and moderately-armoured vehicles deployed by an FTL-capable nation, or piercing through several redundant shields erected by a person with sufficiently high magical ability or technology.

It is a bulky, multi-barrelled configuration that is capable of firing Void-charged 22.26mm Advanced Self-propelled Shield/Armour Penetrator Munitions at a rate of about 150 rounds per minute in extremely high velocities. It is thus capable of punching through several layers of advanced kinetic shielding, while retaining enough kinetic energy to punch through a composition of heavy armour, in ranges reaching up to ten kilometres away.

Types of Citadels \u00b6 Anchor Citadel Support Vessel/Mobile Outpost Used to serve as a refuelling and resupply station for Hexagon and allied vessels. Usually immobile. Has no offensive capabilities. Relay Citadel Support Vessel/Mobile Outpost Used to serve as a warp station for Hexagon vessels. Usually immobile. Has decent offensive capabilities. Hive Citadel Support Vessel Used to serve as a refuelling and resupply station for Hexagon and allied vessels within combat areas. Has minimal offensive capabilities. Void Citadel Combat Vessel Used to break through heavily defended areas using superior firepower. Acquisition Citadel Expansion Vessel Used to create Nexus Superstructures for resource acquisition. Has no offensive capabilities. Grand Citadel ^e8486a Support Vessel/Mobile Outpost A combination of the past Anchor and Relay Citadels. Deploys a galaxy-wide area of interference around it, which disrupts enemy communications/relays. Area of interference is further propagated by Stellar Spires , allowing for a much wider area of protection against hostile FTL and communications. Has decent offensive capabilities. Collapse Citadel Support Vessel A specialised Citadel carrying a Multiversal-Range Void Interference Module. Heavily armed and protected, this is a critical part of the Regime\u2019s transportation beyond their Multiverse. Crypt Citadel Support Vessel A unique Citadel used to contain extremely dangerous artefacts and entities for transport. It\u2019s run by a skeleton crew of humans or machines, depending on the artefact or entity that\u2019s being transported. Once compromised, the Citadel releases a massive Void charge, erasing it and everything within a parsec around it. Has extremely overpowering offensive capabilities. Spire \u00b6 Spires , also known as the Deathbringers before the Shatter, large military vessels designed to act as a way point or a defensive structure for use as a larger set in a defence in depth. Types of Spires \u00b6 Deathbringer Combat Vessel Mobile Combat Outpost, features an extensive defence and weapons platform to which it can use to great effect. Is capable of breaking through planets. Stellar Spire Support Vessel Immobile Reconnaissance Outpost, features minimal offensive capabilities but has an advanced jamming and disruption relay. Improves the capabilities of the Grand Citadel. Deployed in random areas around Grand Citadels (at least one per 50 parsecs), it acts as a galaxy group outpost\u2019s threat mitigation system. Like other spires, these spires are capable of docking or warping smaller ships and vessels for resupply and reinforcement. Horizon Spire Support Vessel Propagated ubiquitously near or within borders, and sparingly within allied or Regime Territory. Features an advanced scanner and detection system that\u2019s capable of picking up anomalous or unusual activity within an area diameter of about five parsecs. Features an excellent defence and weapons platform to which it can utilise should it come under attack. Like other spires, these spires are capable of docking or warping smaller ships and vessels for resupply and reinforcement. Extensively deployed within realms beyond the Hexagon\u2019s domain in order for vessels and units to fully utilise their offensive capabilities. Crystal Spire Combat Vessel Deployed in large numbers within heavy combat zones, these spires are equipped with powerful, anti-ship weaponry that\u2019s capable of taking down multiple small moons when utilised in full power. Like other spires, these spires are capable of docking or warping smaller ships and vessels for resupply and reinforcement. Rift Spire Combat Vessel Deployed sparingly within heavy combat zones. Utilises spatial manipulation to move and interact. Tears through hostile ships and defences and bolsters the defences of allied ships. Like other spires, these spires are capable of docking or warping smaller ships and vessels for resupply and reinforcement. Carries Parsec-Range Void Interference Modules, allowing ships to escape Voidspace near the spires. Interlink Spire Support Vessel Deployed ubiquitously within areas outside of the Regime\u2019s home Layer. Interlink Spires directly tear through the fabrics of reality to force a connection with the Pierenne Interlink in order to receive reinforcements and supplies. The amount of Interlink Spires present within an outpost cluster is indicative on how important such an outpost cluster is. Gate \u00b6 Gates are large mega-structures that are utilised by the Hexagon and the Regime as a method of acquiring exotic materials or performing large and complicated tasks. These are one of the most, if not the most common types of mega-structures in the Hexagon and the Regime. Types of Gates \u00b6 Void Gate A large, circular gate that\u2019s used to mine Void Particles outside of the Hexagon\u2019s home Multiverse. Extremely volatile, and has no offensive capabilities. Must be defended at all costs. Rapid Vessel Construction Gate The successor to previous space vessel fabricators, the RVC Gate is a specialised manufacturing gate that\u2019s designed to construct multiple Regime Vessels in an extremely quick and optimised manner. Usually connected to so-called \u2018Breeder Planets\u2019, these gates are capable of amassing small fleets consisting of hundreds of ships in a month, complete with a crew. Instantaneous Bidirectional Spatial Transportation Gate A large, circular gate designed to connect two locations to one another, allowing for instantaneous travel. It\u2019s large enough to fit three stacked Pre-Shatter Alpha Catalyses, and several other gates are located within the structure itself, allowing for the transportation of cargo, equipment, and personnel. Resource Gate A small gate that\u2019s usually part of a larger structure known as a Resource Acquisition Depot. Built in groups of six, these small gates are connected to a small containment facility that houses several artificial spatial fields that are designed to hold an enormously large amount of raw materials. These depots are then connected to the Local Interlink or to the larger Pierenne Interlink for RVC Gates and other macro and micro-scale fabricators to continuously fabricate ad infinitum. High-Security Stasis Gate A medium-sized gate that\u2019s developed by the Regime to contain highly anomalous entities and materials. Ceryn \u00b6 Ceryn are large capital vessels designed by the Regime to achieve spatial dominance over hostile ships. Heavily armed and protected, and utilising some of the most powerful modules and technologies within the Regime, Ceryn are usually found leading a massive tangent, spearheading the assault through sheer superior firepower. Ceryn are further divided into three classifications, each having their own sub-types. There are usually two of these ships in one Tangent, with at the very least one Serrht leading the charge. Types of Ceryn \u00b6 Serrht Heavily protected vessels that pull enemy projectiles towards it through several MARS, however said MARS may be used to perform abilities of the other Ceryn in a smaller efficiency. Enemy projectiles are usually dissipated and processed into their most basic components, or launched back towards enemy attackers. Carries a secondary detachable vessel within it. Acts as the primary command-and-control vessel of the fleet. Command centre is located within said detachable vessel, allowing the officers to escape should the primary vessel be destroyed or taken. Gradht Lean and slim vessels capable of masking most detectable signals of Hexagon vessels through specialised MARS. Other specialised Gradht are capable of creating decoy signals, illusion ships, and many more. Known Gradht Specialisations \u00b6 Surveyor and Support Slimmer, less powerful Gradht equipped with extremely sensitive data gathering equipment. Utilised mainly by Pre-Combat Tangents, Surveyor and Support vessels mainly operate with little to no offensive capabilities, depending on their escorts to survive. Rukht Large and bulky vessels capable of connecting to the Interlink. Generally follows behind the fleet, and protected by a large assortment of unmanned drones and fighters, Rukhts act as mobile ship producers of the fleet, allowing them to take material and personnel from the Interlink and fabricate necessary ships when needed. Sanckht \u00b6 Sanckht are easily mass-produced combat vessels designed by the Regime for a large assortment of combat purposes. While more of a general classification than an actual ship type, Sanckht are divided into several types, which excel in their appropriate duties and purposes. Types of Sanckht \u00b6 Akadht Generalised Assault Vessel Small and fast vessels that are usually accompanied by large swarms of smaller and quicker unmanned attack craft. These unmanned craft usually act as sword and shield to these vessels, pestering larger ships while the Akadht attacks with its stronger weaponry, or taking the brunt of incoming attacks that could easily defeat it. Some variants of the Akadht are capable of creating more drones, at the cost of having one or more of its modules replaced with fabricators, leading to diminished performance in the modules it replaced. A select few Akadht types have real space drives installed. Giywn Interceptor Unit Extremely small vessels that have several built-in warp drives and time-manipulation modules whose main purpose is to track down and follow or destroy warping spacecraft. Some variants are best suited for tracking and marking locations, while others are best suited for combat and actual interception. Vetzcht Specialised Support-Combat Vessel A sub-category that contains most smaller combat vessels with specialised purposes. - Containment Vetzcht - Expedition Vetzcht - Medical Vetzcht - Rift Vetzcht - Interlink Vetzcht","title":"Hexagon Ship Type"},{"location":"hidden/Hexagon%20Ship%20Type/#superstructure-variants","text":"","title":"Superstructure Variants"},{"location":"hidden/Hexagon%20Ship%20Type/#citadel","text":"The Citadel is a large, usually non-combat artificially built star-ship outpost designed to dock, supply, and warp in Hexagon/Regime units and vessels.
