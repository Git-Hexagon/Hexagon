**OOC**: ICly, you're browsing the site by using the account of a deceased, traitorous Seer. As such, some documents are password-locked to give the illusion of this account having insufficient clearance to access them. Codes for the documents can be usually found in my NSForum posts, or in my factbooks. Of course, you can read the notes without a password by checking this site's GitHub page, but this ruins the illusion and fun.
