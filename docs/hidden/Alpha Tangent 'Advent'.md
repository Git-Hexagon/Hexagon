**Advent** is a gigantic Alpha-type Tangent that's decentralised and spread out in different sectors. The weakest of all the tangents in the Neo-Hexagon's disposal, it's equipped with just enough weaponry to harass fledgling FTL civilizations' dreadnoughts and battlecruisers.

It's mainly used to scout areas with an unknown Escalation level, and thus has vessels that prioritize detection and reconnaissance over actual combat. It's meant to set the stage for the main fleet, as well as to send data to the mainframe for any future Solar Expeditionary Tangents planning on building an outpost there.
