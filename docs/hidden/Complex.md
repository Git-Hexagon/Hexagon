**Complexes** are military units that are widely utilized in the Neo-Hexagon and the Regime.

A term used to describe a homogenous group of agents belonging to a single department, it is one of the most common military unit terms to be used in an order of battle.

Complexes are further divided into microcomplexes and nanocomplexes. These two units are used to describe battle-ready units that are deployed in combat areas. It is extremely rare for an entire complex to be deployed as a whole, even in extremely large combat areas.

The combination of two complexes are known as a <u>Truncation</u>. Truncations are still divided into microcomplexes and nanocomplexes.


| Unit         | No. of Agents         | Example of use in ORBAT                                                                                          |

| Truncation   | 1,000,000 - 2,000,000 | Thanatos' Hazardous Disposal Unit – 64th Truncation                                                              |
| Microcomplex | 20,000                | 33rd Devastation Complex – 10th Microcomplex **OR** 64th Truncation's 10th Microcomplex                               |
| Nanocomplex  | 1,000                 | 10th Microcomplex – Nanocomplex A                                                                                |
