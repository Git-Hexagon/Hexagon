> The Neo-Hexagon and the Regime's standard infantry weapon. It is a coil-operated [[The Art of Supportive Chronostasis|chronoresistant]] ballistic weapon designed with longevity and reliability in mind. Its design allows agents to operate in an extremely prolonged timeframe, with the intent of outlasting the enemy's physical and logistical limitations in a war of attrition.

The Expeditionary Personal Defense Weapon is a compact, moderately-strong coil-gun designed by the Hexagon and the Regime for use as a standard infantry weapon by agents in normal sorties and deployments.

Agents in the field have the ability to change the power output of their weapon, allowing them to take on any enemy in any environment, from mitigating collateral damage within a high-population area with a low charge shot, to penetrating through dense, sloped heavy armour with a max charge shot.

Capable of firing 6.4x27 HKP-01 Kinetic Penetrator slugs at a fire-rate of about 250 rounds per minute, it's used to pick off targets—armoured or not—in ranges less than three kilometres or so.

#### Variants of the Expeditionary PDW
#####  'C1.13-01A'
The C1.13-01A variant of the Expeditionary is moderately-strong automatic coil-gun designed with the intent of creating a powerful and accurate weapon for standard battle-agents. Capable of firing 6.4mm HKP-01 Kinetic Penetrator slugs at a fire-rate of about 650 rounds per minute, it's mainly used against groups of unarmoured targets or to disable moderately armoured vehicles at ranges less than two kilometres or so.

Like the C1.13-00, the C1.13-01A has a casing that allows it to operate within chronostatic environments. It is, however, longer than the C1.13-00.

##### 'C1.13-01A(MB)'
The C1.13-01A(MB) variant of the Expeditionary is a rarely used variant of the C1.13-01A. Basically having the same features as its parent weapon, the only difference is that this features a rotating multi-barrelled configuration and a faster rate of fire.

It is capable of firing 6.4mm HKP-01 Kinetic Penetrator slugs at a fire-rate of about 2500 rounds per minute. It is bulkier and heavier than the C1.13-01A, and is usually found mounted in terrestrial military installations found in hostile areas, or as a hastily prepared fabricated emplacement used to guard chokepoints or corridors in buildings, vessels, etc.

It's capable of completely tearing through groups or punching through armoured columns in ranges less than a kilometre or so.

##### 'C1.13-02S(B)'
The C1.13-02S(B) variant of the Expeditionary is a powerful, semi-automatic coil-cannon developed to give battleagents a fighting chance against armour deployed by $Dynamic\, State\, A_{7}$-rated civilizations. Operating with a specialised binary firing system, it is designed to fire 8.6mm Specialized Shieldbreaker Spine munitions and 17.2mm Kinetic Penetrator Void-charged Sabots in quick succession at extremely high velocities. It is thus capable of punching through one or two lightly-shielded and moderately-armoured vehicles deployed by an FTL-capable nation, or piercing through several redundant shields erected by a person with sufficiently high magical ability or technology.

Its fire-rate allows it to fire two-round bursts of both shield piercing and armour piercing projectiles at a rate of about 100 two-round bursts per minute.

##### 'C1.13-03A'
The C1.13-03A variant of the Expeditionary is a rare, large and powerful, coil-autocannon developed to give exoskeleton-wearing agents a suitable weapon for fighting armoured divisions. It is a bulky, multi-barrelled configuration that is capable of firing Void-charged 22.26mm Advanced Self-propelled Shield/Armour Penetrator Munitions at a rate of about 150 rounds per minute in extremely high velocities.

It is thus capable of punching through several layers of advanced kinetic shielding, while retaining enough kinetic energy to punch through a composition of heavy armour, in ranges reaching up to ten kilometres away.

Like the C1.13-01A(MB), it can be seen mounted in terrestrial military installations found in hostile areas, or as a hastily prepared fabricated emplacement used to guard chokepoints or open areas.
