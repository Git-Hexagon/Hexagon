> [[Hexagon Ship Type#Types of Sanckht|Akadht]] vessels are small Sanckht-class vessels that are commonly deployed within tangents due to their ability to fabricate unmanned vessels in an extremely fast rate. Modular, and easy to configure and change, these ships are almost always present in every Neo-Hexagon division since its creation.

Its main armament, however, is a batch of onboard vessel arrays capable of holding several smaller vessels—usually unmanned—ready to be deployed in a moment's notice.

# Sanckht-class, Akadht-type Vessels

After the [[Collapse]], the Neo-Hexagon sought to improve their classifications of their space vessels. Sanckht-class vessels were designated as those that are easily mass-produced and fabricated through RVC Gates, and the **Akadht-type Vessel** was created in the first generation of Sanckht-class vessel types, alongside the Giywn and the Vetzcht.

Akadht Vessels are small, agile vessels manned by a crew of several men supported by several autonomous units.
