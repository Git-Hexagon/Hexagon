> [[Hexagon Ship Type#Types of Sanckht|Akadht]] vessels are small Sanckht-class vessels that are commonly deployed within tangents due to their ability to fabricate unmanned vessels in an extremely fast rate. Modular, and easy to configure and change, these ships are almost always present in every Neo-Hexagon division since its creation.
> 
> It is almost always deployed with one heavy kinetic-based or energy-based [[Advanced Modular Weapon Systems|Advanced Modular Weapon System]], and equipped with two or three light kinetic-based AMWS. Its main armament, however, is a batch of onboard vessel arrays capable of holding several smaller vessels—usually unmanned—ready to be deployed in a moment's notice.

# Sanckht-class, Akadht-type Vessels

After the [[Collapse]], the Neo-Hexagon sought to improve their classifications of their space vessels. Sanckht-class vessels were designated as those that are easily mass-produced and fabricated through RVC Gates, and the **Akadht-type Vessel** was created in the first generation of Sanckht-class vessel types, alongside the Giywn and the Vetzcht.

Akadht Vessels are small, agile vessels manned by a crew of several men supported by several autonomous units.

## Production Arrays

Akadht-type and Rukht-type Vessels are always equipped with at least one array. Arrays are large, onboard containment and fabrication units designed to dock and/or create vessels for use in combat. Each array has a different purpose, and thus, there are several types of arrays that are currently in use.

An Akadht-type or a Rukht-type Vessel listed in an Order of Battle are always accompanied by the vessel it is designed to dock, as well as its type, followed by a designation code below it. Some examples are listed below.

> **Gehenna's First Expeditionary Microtangent, First Void Division**
> - *Specialised Voidbound Command and Control Akadht* [01-24]
> 	- Autonomous Voidbound Giwyn Interceptor, Chrono-divergent Auto-fabricator Array [1-4]
> 		- 512.00-64-105(V)

The type `Chrono-divergent Auto-fabricator Array [1-4]`, as well as the designation code `512.00-64-105B(V)` gives the following information:
- It is chrono-divergent, meaning that it can still produce ships at the same rate, despite chronological interference.
- It is capable of producing vessels automatically even if there are already existing ships assigned to the docks.
- There are four arrays present in the Akadht.
- The arrays hold enough raw materials to produce 512 ships.
- The array has 64 docks, allowing for production, fabrication, resupply, and repair.
- It is capable of producing 105 ships a minute.
- It is currently designed for instantaneous Void deployment.

> Gehenna's Third Expeditionary Microtangent, First Parsec Division
> - *Ceryn-class, Rukht-type Central Supply and Production Vessel, 'Genesis'* [1]
> 	- Autonomous Multi-vessel Fabricator, Chrono-divergent Auto-fabricator Array [1-24]
> 		- 86400.00-384-2880(RV)
> - *Ceryn-class, Rukht-type Specialised Carrier Vessel'* [1-6]
> 	- Multi-vessel Docking Unit, Maintenance and Resupply Array [1-200]
> 		- 120000.00-200-000(D)

For the first one, the type `Autonomous Multi-vessel Fabricator, Chrono-divergent Auto-fabricator`, as well as the designation code `86400.00-384-2880(RV)` gives the following information:
- It is autonomous, meaning additional vessels may be automatically produced depending on the status of the combat scenario, as examined by on-board sensors.
- It is a multi-vessel fabricator, meaning it is capable of fabricating and producing multiple types of Sanckht-class vessels.
- It is chrono-divergent, meaning that it can still produce ships at the same rate, despite chronological interference.
- It is an auto-fabricator, which means that it is capable of producing vessels automatically even if there are already existing ships assigned to the docks.
- There are twenty-four arrays present in the Rukht.
- The arrays hold enough raw materials to repair or fabricate 86 thousand vessels.
- The arrays have 384 docks all in all, which count 16 for each array.
- The arrays can produce 2880 ships a minute, or 120 ships per array.
- It is designed for both instantaneous real-space and void deployment.

For the second one, the type `Multi-vessel Docking Unit, Maintenance and Resupply Array`, designation code `120000.00(IT)-200-000(D)`, gives the following information:
- It is a multi-vessel docking unit, meaning it is capable of docking and maintaining multiple types of vessels as long as it fits.
- It is a maintenance and resupply array, meaning that its main purpose is to repair and resupply vessels.
- It can repair a hundred and twenty thousand ships before its raw materials are depleted.
- It, however, can continuously replenish its materials through the Interlink, and it is capable of transmitting material-based Interlink signals to other vessels, allowing for a very quick and efficient remote method of resupplying.
- It is only designed for normal docking, and is not specialised for in-combat rapid deployment.
