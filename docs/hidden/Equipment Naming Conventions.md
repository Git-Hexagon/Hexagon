> As the development of new gear began to exponentially increase, the Neo-Hexagon and the Apeirogon Regime have adopted a naming system to better classify and list the ever growing arsenal of the Regime and the Empire.
> 
> More obscure or unrecognised equipment are not subject to this naming convention, and are instead named something else by their inventors.
