<u>Entry SC-15a-u3Y6vb</u> [0000 - zbp0]
*Kvytch Sub-variant*
**Anathema** $(a5on00)$

Bio-containment Procedures: BC-014
Techno-containment Procedures: TC-000
Method of Transmission: <u><i>Exposure to Anathema particles.</i></u>
Most Common Variant: (database code: u3Y6vb [004])

**Notes**: <u>All personnel and autonomous units present in contaminated areas must be subjected to Void termination, even if they have no record of exposure to the substance.</u> The condition is noted to be extremely easy to propagate and is difficult to completely eradicate without enacting heavy sterilisation protocols. <u><b>Failure to comply will lead to the vessel or outpost's immediate termination due to advanced biocontamination</b></u>.

## Notable Symptoms
#### Biological Infected
> No noticeable symptoms will be felt or openly displayed by infected individuals.
> 
> The bodies of deceased infected would quickly deteriorate in speeds immensely faster than normal decomposition. Do note that the body will become a vector for this disease, and any fluid, material, or gas that is emitted during this decomposition phase will harbor Anathema. After a sufficient time has passed, the biomass—also known as 'Ego'—would reanimate and lash out to nearby creatures, intent on wounding or killing.

#### Technological Infected
> Unlike its more dangerous counterpart (u3Y6vb), the Kvytch sub-variant of the Anathaema is incapable of infecting technologically based intelligences.

#### Recommended Procedures
> In the case of an unintentional outbreak, the planet must immediately be designated as a Level 14 biohazard, and must either be abandoned or completely wiped out with a singular Void explosion.
> 
> Should the planet be important enough for the Hexagon to leave behind, an Emergency Response Tangent must be called to assess the situation. Due to how quickly and easily it can propagate, a one-hundred square kilometre area must be designated as a red-zone for every microlitre of Anathema that has been leaked.
> 
> Infected personnel cannot be cured without the complete replacement of every cell, material, and fluid in the body, all at once.
> 
> Agents may be authorized to utilise Void weaponry against Anathema, depending on the decisions of the highest ranking authorised officer.
> 
> <u>The CDDCPD will not cooperate or interact with any population or units that have been exposed to Anathema, and thus, Disease Control Centres or Quarantine Centres will not be built in biohazard-designated planets or vessels.</u>

## Possible Cures
**There are no known cures for an Anathema infection other than a complete body replacement.**
