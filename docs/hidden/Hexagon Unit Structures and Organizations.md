# Hexagon Unit Structures and Organizations

> An index containing most, if not all of the [[The Hexagon|Hexagon]], Neo-Hexagon, and the Regime's unit formations, structures, and organizations.
> 
> This page will only contain minor descriptions.
---

## General Units
> Terms for formations that either contain all known military entities, from surface-bound to voidborne, or are used in two or more areas of combat.

### Apeirogon
> The entirety of the Apeirogon Regime's military force.

### Alpha-Tangent
> A gigantic military unit consisting of several tangents. May have specialised roles. There are usually several present within a universe, and some may be spread out in several multiverses, depending on their role.

### Tangent
> A large military unit consisting of a multitude of vessels, structures, reality-based and nonreality-based units. Is further separated into microtangents.

### Microtangent
> A large military unit consisting of a large number of vessels, structures, reality-based and nonreality-based units.

### Division
> A specialised military unit formed to perform tasks at a smaller scale.

## Spaceborne Fleets
### Expeditionary Tangent
> The basic unit formation utilized by spaceborne units.

##### Solar Expeditionary Tangent
> A unit formation whose role is to scour the interstellar medium for areas of interest, in places where there are either large quantities of matter or where the Realspace/Voidspace Wall is weak. Its purpose is to create structures that would utilize nearby resources to be able to fuel and resupply the Alpha-Tangent.

##### Combat Expeditionary Tangent
> A unit formation whose role is to serve as the main combat unit for an Alpha-Tangent.

##### Research Expeditionary Tangent
> A unit formation whose role is to explore, capture, and study specimens or artefacts. While being a research unit, it harbours a large military force.

##### Autonomous Expeditionary Tangent
> A unit formation that acts independently from the Alpha-Tangent. They are usually diplomacy-oriented or combat-oriented divisions built to deal with smaller problems that specialised expeditionary tangents are overqualified to handle.

##### Pre-Combat Expeditionary Tangent
> A unit formation mainly utilised by [[Alpha Tangent 'Advent'|Advent]] and rarely used by other Alpha-Tangents. Usually the first ones in a battlefield, they are deployed to determine the relative [[Escalation of Arms|Escalation State]] in a combat skirmish.

#### Expeditionary Division
> Operating under a microtangent, Expeditionary Divisions are small, specialised fleets of vessels designed to operate within specific areas.

##### Parsec Expeditionary Division
> A very flexible military unit that's used to conduct interstellar to interplanetary actions within a given area of operations. May perform actions and objectives such as creating and defending a military outpost behind enemy lines, to staging planetary assaults on a hostile world.

##### Stellar Expeditionary Division/Subdivision
> A military unit consisting of anti-spacecraft vessels and carrier vessels. Used to carry out tasks within stellar systems. Harbours a multitude of surface-based units for planetary assaults and takeovers. Smaller units of this type may be assigned to a Parsec Expeditionary Division as a subdivision.

##### Scientific Expeditionary Division/Subdivision
> A unit consisting of research-based and sensor-equipped vessels protected by several combat vessels. Carries a large surface-based military force for acquisition, securement, and capture. Smaller units of this type may be assigned to a Parsec Expeditionary Division as a subdivision.

##### Surveyor Expeditionary Division/Subdivision
> A small military unit consisting of at least two sensor-equipped vessels and their escorts. Used exclusively by Pre-Combat Expeditionary Tangents, these formations are not combat-capable in any way. Smaller units of this type may be assigned to a Parsec Expeditionary Division as a subdivision.

##### Autonomous Acquisition Division/Subdivision
> A military unit consisting of autonomous units designed to follow one of three functions: propagate, consume, or protect. Propagate causes autonomous units to spread rapidly across star systems and astronomical bodies. Minor outposts are then built on capable ground, and are handled by autonomous units. Consume causes the disintegration and extraction of mass. Protect allows autonomous units to lay dormant and await further orders. Smaller units of this type may be assigned to a Parsec Expeditionary Division as a subdivision.

## Surface-bound Units

## Voidbound Units
### Voidbound Division
> The largest Void-based military formation that the Neo-Hexagon is willing to create. Anything larger is a detriment due to how dangerous the Void is.

##### Void Division/Subdivision
> Consists of several void-bound interceptors. Deployed to intercept voidbound vessels breaching to and from voidspace close to Neo-Hexagon borders. Vessels may also carry reality-based munitions and payloads to act as an instantaneous quick-reaction force. Smaller units of this type may be assigned to a Parsec Expeditionary Division as an expeditionary subdivision.

## Extrareality-bound Units
