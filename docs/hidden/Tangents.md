**Related Notes:** 

**Tangents** are large units consisting of a multitude of vessels, superstructures, megastructures, military personnel, and robotic units. Led by Grand Citadels, Tangents are capable of operating autonomously and are capable of erecting additional outposts, producer structures, and forward bases to further add to their military capabilities.

They're superseded by Alpha Tangents, which are organised military units established by Neo-Hexagon departments to conduct military actions at a universal level.

Tangents are usually found conducting military actions at a galactic level, or in specialised roles at a cross-multiversal level. (see [[Alpha Tangent 'Advent']])
