**Related Notes:** 

The **Advanced Modular Weapon System** is an extremely diverse family of weapon systems that are designed by the Neo-Hexagon as a successor to the previous [[Mobile Live Weapons Systems]].

Its main feature is that it utilises an installed microfabricator to build its weapons from a blank, standardized mount. This gives users the ability to 'switch' its armaments even in the heat of combat, allowing the user to fully combat anything the enemy may give them.

However, this function is severely restricted, and is subject to user clearance, the current escalation level, and the local Command and Control Centre's orders.

The AMWS is capable of constructing three major weapon systems: Kinetic, Energy, and Exotic.

Like the Mk.III iteration of the MLWS series, the AMWS features three sub-classifications that further break down the three weapon systems: Lineage, Shards, and Fragments.

| Stage of Escalation | Class    |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| N                   | EX-Class |
| 10                  | EX-Class |
| 9                   | MX-Class |
| 8                   | HX-Class |
| 7                   | VX-Class |
| 6                   | D-Class  |
| 5                   | C-Class  |
| 4                   | B-Class  |
| 3                   | B-Class  |
| 2                   | A-Class  |
