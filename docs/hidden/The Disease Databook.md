The **Disease Databook** is a large, growing database covering most of the ailments, conditions, and diseases that the Hexagon has encountered. 

It contains entries of biological, technological, and thaumaturgical ailments and conditions, and explains the known containment procedures, treatments, and cures required to handle them.

It also lists down additional notes, other info, and the symptoms of said diseases, as well as the efficacy of the standard cures and treatments that the Hexagon has in their disposal. It also handles the protocol and the standard operating procedures that [[Tangents]] should follow during an outbreak of a disease.
