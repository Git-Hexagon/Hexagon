**Related Notes:** 

The **C1 Expeditionary** is a mid-powered coil-gun designed by the Hexagon and the Regime to be used by agents in normal sorties and deployments. Agents in the field have the ability to change the power within this gun, allowing them to change it as they see fit, preserving power and mitigating collateral damage through overpenetration.

The C1 has several variants available.

#### C1-07S Expeditionary
The *C1-07S Expeditionary* is a mid-powered semi-automatic coil-gun designed with the intent of creating a powerful and accurate weapon for the Hexagon's main battle-agents. Capable of firing at a maximum fire-rate of about 600 rounds per minute, it's mainly used to take mid to long-ranged distance shots at enemy units, however it also excels in close quarters, due to the gun's low profile. It mainly fires HKP-01 Standard Osmium Penetrator (6.4x27) rounds.

Without any connection to the Pierenne's Interlink, the agent has about two hundred thousand max-velocity rounds worth of power, yet their maximum round output should be at about six hundred and fifty thousand rounds.

The C1-07S is capable of launching said osmium slugs at a maximum speed of about 10 kilometres per second (with it capable of higher speeds with smaller slugs), allowing the agent to use the weapon as a long-ranged rifle for taking out snipers. To compliment this, the weapon's built-in sight has a variable zoom of about 20x.

Agents are trained to fire this weapon slowly, shooting one bullet every after short pause. This is to maintain accuracy and to keep the weapon from using too much power. The weapon, however, is capable of firing automatically, albeit in a slow rate of fire.
